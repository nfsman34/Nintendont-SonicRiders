### What Nintendont will never support:

### Quick Installation:
1. Do either of the following:
  a) Get the [loader.dol](loader/loader.dol?raw=true), rename it to boot.dol and put it in /apps/Nintendont/ along with the files [meta.xml](nintendont/meta.xml?raw=true) and [icon.png](nintendont/icon.png?raw=true) for an up to date build.
  or b) Download the zip from Releases and extract it to /apps/ on your SD card or USB

2. Copy your GameCube games to the /games/ directory. Subdirectories are optional for 1-disc games in ISO/GCM and CISO format.
   * For 2-disc games, you should create a subdirectory /games/MYGAME/ (where MYGAME can be anything), then name disc 1 as "game.iso" and disc 2 as "disc2.iso".
   * For extracted FST, the FST must be located in a subdirectory, e.g. /games/FSTgame/sys/boot.bin .
3. Connect your storage device to your Wii or Wii U and start The Homebrew Channel.
4. Select Nintendont.

### Compiling:
For compile Nintendont yourself, get the following versions of the toolchain compiling PPC tools:
* **devkitARM r53-1**
* **devkitPPC r35-2**
* **libOGC 1.8.23-1**

These versions can be downloaded here: https://www.mediafire.com/folder/j0juqb5vvd6z5/devkitPro_archives

Make sure that they are on your path (including the bin subdirectories), if using Windows.

On Windows, run the "Build.bat" batch script for build Nintendont.

On Unix, run the "Build.sh" script.

Please use these specific versions for compiling Nintendont, **because if you try to compile them on latest dkARM/dkPPC/libOGC, you'll get a lot of compiler warnings and your build will crash when attemping to return to Nintendont menu**, so be warned about that.

### Notes
* The Wii and Wii U SD card slot is known to be slow. If you're using an SD card and are having performance issues, consider either using a USB SD reader or a USB hard drive.
* USB flash drives are known to be problematic.
* Nintendont runs best with storage devices formatted with 32 KB clusters. (Use either FAT32 or exFAT.)
